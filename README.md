# Library

Library application for the Odin Project

Assignment:

## Features

- New book button displays book input form

- Form creates book objects that are then stored in an array and then a loop displays all books on the page

- Remove button on each book as well as ability to change from 'read' or 'not read'

### Process

- Created book logic using object construcors

- Created dynamic ul that updates the page as titles are added

- Used preventDefault() on the submit button and took formData to create object props

- Added logic to allow remove button to delete book and remove it from the DOM as well as the array

- Added bookRead() which toggles a book to 'read' or 'not read'

- Refactored using Class instead of object constructors

- Centered layout and added logic to prevent leaving form blank
